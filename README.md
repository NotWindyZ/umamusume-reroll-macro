## üìù Notes

- On first run, a default `config.ini` will be created if missing. _If you lose or delete it, just restart the macro!_
- All configuration is saved in `config.ini` and can be edited via the GUI.
- Screenshots for Discord notifications are saved temporarily and deleted after sending.
- For best OCR results, assign card regions as tightly as possible around the card rarity icons.
- The macro will not run unless all required regions/clicks are assigned.
- All logs are saved to `macro_log.txt` (rotates at 5MB) and successful reroll accounts to `met_required_accounts.txt` (rotates at 10MB).

## ‚ö° Optional: Enable GPU Support for Faster OCR

By default, the macro uses CPU for EasyOCR. This is fine for most users, but it can be a little slow.  
If you have an **NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support**, you can install **PyTorch with CUDA** inside the embedded Python environment to make OCR much faster.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Installing GPU support will download about **7 GB** of data.
Just locate the bat file: **`install-ocr-gpu-support.bat`**

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Common Problems

- **`config.ini` missing or corrupted?**  
  The macro will auto-create a default `config.ini` on startup. Just restart the macro.

- **OCR not working or inaccurate?**  
  - Make sure your screen is scaled (100% recommended).
  - Nvidia GPU for faster card detection
  - If OCR fails to load, try reinstalling EasyOCR or ensure your graphics drivers are up to date.
  - For best results, assign card regions closely around the rarity icons.

- **Macro doesn't detect the game window?**  
  - The game must be running and visible!
  - Fullscreen on the game also!

- **Discord notifications not sending?**  
  - Double-check your Discord webhook URL.

- **Can't find `start_macro.bat`?**  
  - If missing, create a `.bat` file with the following content in the macro folder:
    ```bat
    @echo off
    REM === Always go into MACRO_HERE_OPEN_IT folder first ===
    cd /d "%~dp0MACRO_HERE_OPEN_IT"
    
    REM === Run main.py with the embedded python.exe ===
    "..\python.exe" "main.py"
    
    echo.
    echo Macro finished running.
    pause
    ```
  - Then create a shortcut to this `.bat` on your desktop for easy access.
